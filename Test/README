This folder contains the testing results of both simulated data and real data. The results are separated by datasets, ili year and then result type.

- Plots: 
   Scatterplot: before_trans_joint# and after_trans_joint# that shows the improved feature alingment through the program
   Histogram: Consistency of feature growth as an indicatr of good alignment and thus good matching
  
- Critical Matrices:
   P matrix, x_trans, affine matrix
   
- Evaluation Table:
   Contains critical statistics that measures the performanc of the algorith and points the direction of enhancement

- Data Output:
   Data that merges updated coordinates after transformation
