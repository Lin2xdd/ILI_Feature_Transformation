To automate feature transformation with a merged list containing multiple ili years of joints, we built an interconnected program of three layers. As long as the data we are testing is also a merged list, we only need to modify the global parameters in Layer 1. This will maximize processing speed by reducing repitions and avoid creating errors. 

# Input Data
{Distance(m),Orientation(deg/clockwise position)}

# Parameters:
iliyr(fix & move), Joint Number, diameter

#Structure

- Layer 1: Iteration over multiple yeras and global parameter setup
- Layer 2: Parameter setup for each ili yera
- Layer 3: Transformation, main script
